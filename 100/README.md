## What is NativeScript?​

NativeScript provides platform APIs directly to the JavaScript runtime (with strong types) for a rich TypeScript development experience.

Some popular use cases:

- Building iOS, Android and Vision Pro apps with a shared codebase (aka, cross platform apps)
- Building native platform apps with portable JavaScript skills
- Augmenting JavaScript projects with platform API capabilities
- AndroidTV and Watch development
- watchOS development
- Learning native platforms through JavaScript understanding
- Exploring platform API documentation by trying APIs directly from a web browser without requiring a platform development machine setup


## Why NativeScript?​

- JavaScript skill reuse
- Natural platform feel and performance characteristics
- Improve how Platform developers can work together with JavaScript developers
- Strengthening job market potential by allowing developers to port their skills between different environments
- Fully open source and a member of OpenJS Foundation, supporting the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole

This is all facilitated by the supported platform runtimes:

- @nativescript/android
- @nativescript/ios
- @nativescript/visionos

To aid in cross-platform development, common use cases are implemented in @nativescript/core utilizing the underlying native APIs provided by each runtime.

Many popular JavaScript frameworks can be used; often referred to as flavors, for example:

- Plain JavaScript or TypeScript—currently part of @nativescript/core, uses XML to declare the UI and JavaScript classes for data binding
- Angular—published under @nativescript/angular
- Vue—published under nativescript-vue
- React—published under react-nativescript
- Svelte—published under svelte-native

There's more!

Given how NativeScript is built, new flavors can be implemented on top of it anytime. A few great examples from the community:

- SolidJS
- rEFui
- and more with DOMiNATIVE
